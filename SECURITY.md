## Security Measures

This project implements several security measures:

1. **Dependency Scanning**: All dependencies are regularly scanned for known vulnerabilities using:

   - GitHub's Dependabot
   - OWASP Dependency Check
   - Snyk vulnerability scanner

1. **Code Analysis**:

   - Bandit for Python security linting
   - CodeQL analysis
   - SonarCloud continuous code quality

1. **CI/CD Security**:

   - All CI/CD pipelines run with minimal permissions
   - Secrets are managed through AWS Secrets Manager
   - Dependencies are locked and verified

1. **Release Process**:

   - All releases are signed
   - SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) is generated for each release
   - Security scanning is performed before each release
