# Code Quality Process Improvements

This document outlines the simplifications and standardizations made to the code quality process.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Simplified Pre-commit Configuration**

   - Removed redundant pre-push-check-all hook
   - Moved Python compatibility check to CI (already handled there)
   - Removed shellcheck verification requirement
   - Consolidated GitHub Actions validation scripts

1. **Consolidated GitHub Actions Validation**

   - Combined multiple validation scripts into a single, maintainable script
   - Improved error reporting and validation logic
   - Reduced complexity while maintaining the same validation coverage

1. **Removed Redundant Scripts**

   - Deleted `.github/scripts/pre-push-check.sh` (functionality already in pre-commit)
   - Simplified the overall script structure

1. **Updated Documentation**

   - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect the simplified process
   - Added clearer guidance on code quality tools and their usage

## Benefits

1. **Faster Local Development**

   - Removed slow checks from pre-commit hooks
   - Focused pre-commit on fast, essential checks
   - Moved comprehensive testing to CI

1. **Reduced Complexity**

   - Fewer scripts to maintain
   - Clearer, more focused validation logic
   - Simplified setup requirements (no shellcheck needed)

1. **Maintained Quality Standards**

   - All important checks are still performed
   - CI matrix testing ensures Python compatibility
   - Comprehensive validation of GitHub Actions

1. **Better Developer Experience**

   - Clearer documentation
   - Faster feedback cycle
   - Less friction in the development process

## Standardized Tools

The code quality process now relies on these standard tools:

1. **Ruff** - For linting and formatting Python code
1. **Pyright** - For static type checking
1. **UV** - For dependency management
1. **Pre-commit** - For running checks before commits
1. **GitHub Actions** - For CI/CD and comprehensive testing

## Risk Mitigation

To ensure no errors are committed despite the simplifications:

1. **CI Matrix Testing** - Comprehensive testing across Python versions and platforms
1. **Simplified but Complete Validation** - All critical checks are maintained
1. **Clear Documentation** - Better guidance on the code quality process
1. **Focused Pre-commit Hooks** - Essential checks run locally, comprehensive checks in CI
