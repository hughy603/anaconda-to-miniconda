# Code Quality Process Improvements

This document outlines the simplifications and standardizations made to the code quality process.

## Summary of Changes

1. **Simplified Pre-commit Configuration**

   - Removed redundant pre-push-check-all hook
   - Moved Python compatibility check to CI (already handled there)
   - Removed shellcheck verification requirement
   - Consolidated GitHub Actions validation scripts
   - Moved formatting checks to pre-commit stage (instead of pre-push)
   - Removed semantic-release validation from pre-push
   - Explicitly specified stages for all hooks
   - Ensured consistent tool availability across all stages

1. **Consolidated GitHub Actions Validation**

   - Combined multiple validation scripts into a single, maintainable script
   - Improved error reporting and validation logic
   - Reduced complexity while maintaining the same validation coverage

1. **Optimized Git Hooks**

   - Moved formatting checks to pre-commit stage for immediate feedback
   - Configured type checking to run at both commit and push stages
   - Used pre-commit's built-in infrastructure for tool management
   - Ensured consistent tool availability across all stages
   - Eliminated custom scripts in favor of standardized hooks
   - Added explicit stage configuration for all hooks
   - Ensured proper dependency management at commit time

1. **Removed Redundant Scripts**

   - Deleted `.github/scripts/pre-push-check.sh` (functionality already in pre-commit)
   - Simplified the overall script structure

1. **Updated Documentation**

   - Updated CONTRIBUTING.md to reflect the simplified process
   - Added clearer guidance on code quality tools and their usage

## Benefits

1. **Faster Local Development**

   - Removed slow checks from pre-commit hooks
   - Focused pre-commit on fast, essential checks
   - Moved comprehensive testing to CI

1. **Reduced Complexity**

   - Fewer scripts to maintain
   - Clearer, more focused validation logic
   - Simplified setup requirements (no shellcheck needed)

1. **Maintained Quality Standards**

   - All important checks are still performed
   - CI matrix testing ensures Python compatibility
   - Comprehensive validation of GitHub Actions

1. **Better Developer Experience**

   - Clearer documentation
   - Faster feedback cycle
   - Less friction in the development process

## Standardized Tools

The code quality process now relies on these standard tools:

1. **Ruff** - For linting and formatting Python code
1. **Pyright** - For static type checking
1. **UV** - For dependency management
1. **Pre-commit** - For running checks before commits
1. **GitHub Actions** - For CI/CD and comprehensive testing

## Risk Mitigation

To ensure no errors are committed despite the simplifications:

1. **CI Matrix Testing** - Comprehensive testing across Python versions and platforms
1. **Simplified but Complete Validation** - All critical checks are maintained
1. **Clear Documentation** - Better guidance on the code quality process
1. **Focused Pre-commit Hooks** - Essential checks run locally, comprehensive checks in CI
1. **Streamlined Pre-Push Checks** - Fast, essential checks run before pushing

## Pre-Push Hook Implementation

The new pre-push hook implementation:

1. Uses pre-commit's built-in infrastructure:

   - Pyright runs at both commit and push stages
   - GitHub Actions validation runs at both commit and push stages
   - Dependency management runs at commit time
   - Tools are automatically installed and managed by pre-commit
   - Consistent environment across all stages
   - No custom scripts or workarounds needed
   - Explicit stage configuration for all hooks

1. Provides clear error messages when checks fail

1. Is significantly faster than the previous implementation

1. Focuses on preventing common errors without being overly restrictive

This approach ensures that code quality is maintained while allowing developers to work efficiently.
